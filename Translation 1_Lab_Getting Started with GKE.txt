Associate Cloud Engineer - Learning Phase 2 Main Track Channel (2020)
Course: Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals - Core Infrastructure

Lab: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE(Google Kubernetes Engine)
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:
Step 1.Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.
Step 2.Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

Step 1: Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster
#Connect the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE 
	-export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
#Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes
	-gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2
#Check your installed version of Kubernetes
	-kubectl version
#View your running nodes
	-gcloud compute instances list    #Your Kubernetes cluster is now ready for use

Step 2: Run and deploy a container
#Launch a single instance of the nginx container
	-kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10
#View the pod running the nginx container:
	-kubectl get pods
#Expose the nginx container to the Internet:
	-kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer
#View the new service:
	-kubectl get services
#Copy the displayed external IP address. Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. 
	Result: The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.
(Optional)
#Scale up the number of pods running on your service to increase available resources
	-kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3
#Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:
	-kubectl get pods
#Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:
	-kubectl get services
