Associate Cloud Engineer - Learning Phase 2 Main Track Channel (2020)
Course: Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals - Core Infrastructure

Lab: GCP Fundamentals: Getting Started with Compute Engine
In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
-Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
-Connect between the two VM instances.

Steps
Step 1: Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console
         -gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1 --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default" --tags http  
         -gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --action=ALLOW --destination=INGRESS --rules=tcp:80 --target-tags=http 

Step 2:Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface
       #List the zones available and choose the one you want
          	-gcloud compute zones list | grep us-central1
       #Set your default zone to the one you chose 
         	-gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
       #create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone
         	-gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" --subnet "default"

Step 3: Connect between the VM instances.
1.Use the ping command to confirm that my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network
	#Connect to my-vm-2
	   	-gcloud compute ssh my-vm-2   
	#Ping my-vm-1 from my-vm-2:
	  	-ping -c 4 my-vm-1 
	#Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
	  	-ssh my-vm-1
	#At the command prompt on my-vm-1, install the Nginx web server:
	  	-sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
	#Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server
	  	-sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
	#move the cursor to the line just below the h1 header. Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name
	  	-Hi from YOUR_NAME
	#Save file and exit the editor, Confirm that the web server is serving your new page. At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command
	  	-curl http://localhost/      //The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
	#exit the command prompt on my-vm-1 by using the command:
	  	-exit
	#To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command
	  	-curl http://my-vm-1/      //The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
2. Get the external Ip address of my-vm-1 and copy it
	  -gcloud compute instances list
3.Paste the Ip address that you copied and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab and hit enter
	  -You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text
